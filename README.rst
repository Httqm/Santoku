FAQ
========================

Why "Santoku ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well, ... there was Batman and Robin. Now, there is Shinken and Santoku :-)
Actually, since Santoku is designed to be used together with Shinken, I wanted to name it as a Japanese cutting device. However, since Santoku is a very humble piece of software, I could not name it as a deadly weapon :  `a santoku is a japanse kitchen knife <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santoku>`_.

Who is "Santoku" for ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is for anybody willing to automate the creation of Shinken/Nagios configuration files, especially if the monitored devices/hosts are already listed in a database.



Known bugs
================================

This is still in development, so expect a lot !
